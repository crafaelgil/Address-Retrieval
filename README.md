# Address Retrieval

This program supports address retrieval from a CSV file. 

<p float="center">
  <img src="./img 1.png" width=34%/>
  <img src="./img 2.png" width=29% /> 
  <img src="./img 3.png" width=34.5% /> 
</p>

To test this code I used the information provided from the Japan's Postal Service. It can find all possible address that correspond to a specific postal code, a substring and refined search.

## Usage

Clone the git repository and open the directory called Address-Retrieval. Then execute the following command to run the program:
```bash
gcc -c address_retrieval.c && gcc -o address_retrieval.o address_retrieval.c
./address_retrieval.o
```
